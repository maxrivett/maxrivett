## Hi there! 👋 I'm Max 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Computer Science student at UCSD** with a passion for solving problems, building innovative solutions, and contributing to meaningful projects.  

###  🔍 About Me 

You'll probably be better off learning about me at [my website](https://www.maxrivett.com), but the gist is that I am a software developer specializing in back-end development and infrastructure. I enjoy crafting robust and scalable solutions that power exceptional software products.

###  💼 What You'll Find Here  

My GitHub profile isn't much, since the vast majority of my project repos are private. To quickly find some of the projects I am more proud of navigate to the **Projects** section of [my website](https://www.maxrivett.com)!

###  📧 Contact me
- Email: *maxnrivett@gmail.com*

I'm always open to collaboration, new ideas, and exciting opportunities. Feel free to explore my repositories and drop me a message if something catches your eye! 🚀
